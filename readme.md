# Ground Zero

Ground Zero is a starting platform for website designs. It is put together using [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) and many other code snippets I have picked up from blogs or written myself.

This is here so I don't have to pull bits and pieces from old projects when starting a new one. Feel free to use this to start your next project or just grab the bits and pieces you like.


## Features

- Built from [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com).
- Stylesheets pre-processed using [Compass](http://compass-style.org).
- Named meqia query break-points with access in both SCSS and JavaScript. (Modification of [Jeremy Keith's idea](http://adactio.com/journal/5429/).)
- [Universal IE6 Stylesheet](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/universal_internet_explorer_6_css/) served to IE6 and below.
- CSS normalization.
- [Retina Images](http://retina-images.complexcompulsions.com) support out of the box.
- All with liberal documentation and much, much more...


## Contributing

While this is designed to be a starting point for myself and my projects I would love to hear any feedback or improvements you have to offer. Open an issue or pull-request and we can discuss your ideas.

If you use this, hit me up on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jeremyworboys). It's always nice to hear that someone else is using my code.
